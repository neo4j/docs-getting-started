== Listing all constraints ==

To list all constraints with the default output columns, the `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` command can be used.
If all columns are required, use `SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD *`.

.Query
include::includes/administration-constraints-listing-all-constraints.query.adoc[]


One of the output columns from `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` is the name of the constraint.
This can be used to drop the constraint with the <<administration-constraints-drop-constraint, `DROP CONSTRAINT` command>>.
