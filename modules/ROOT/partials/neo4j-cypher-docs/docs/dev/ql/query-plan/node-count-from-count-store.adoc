== Node Count From Count Store ==
The `NodeCountFromCountStore` operator uses the count store to answer questions about node counts.
 This is much faster than the `EagerAggregation` operator which achieves the same result by actually counting.
 However, as the count store only stores a limited range of combinations, `EagerAggregation` will still be used for more complex queries.
 For example, we can get counts for all nodes, and nodes with a label, but not nodes with more than one label.
