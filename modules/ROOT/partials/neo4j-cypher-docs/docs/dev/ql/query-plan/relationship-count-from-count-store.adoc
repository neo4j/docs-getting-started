== Relationship Count From Count Store ==
The `RelationshipCountFromCountStore` operator uses the count store to answer questions about relationship counts.
 This is much faster than the `EagerAggregation` operator which achieves the same result by actually counting.
 However, as the count store only stores a limited range of combinations, `EagerAggregation` will still be used for more complex queries.
 For example, we can get counts for all relationships, relationships with a type, relationships with a label on one end, but not relationships with labels on both end nodes.
