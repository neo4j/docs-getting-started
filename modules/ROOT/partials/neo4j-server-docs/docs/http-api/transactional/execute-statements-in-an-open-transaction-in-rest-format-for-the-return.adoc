=== Execute statements in an open transaction in REST format for the return

Given that you have an open transaction, you can make a number of requests, each of which executes additional
statements, and keeps the transaction open by resetting the transaction timeout. Specifying the `REST` format will
give back full Neo4j Rest API representations of the Neo4j Nodes, Relationships and Paths, if returned.
