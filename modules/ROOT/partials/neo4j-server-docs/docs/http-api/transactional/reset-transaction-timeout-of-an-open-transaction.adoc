=== Reset transaction timeout of an open transaction

Every orphaned transaction is automatically expired after a period of inactivity.  This may be prevented
by resetting the transaction timeout.

The timeout may be reset by sending a keep-alive request to the server that executes an empty list of statements.
This request will reset the transaction timeout and return the new time at which the transaction will
expire as an RFC1123 formatted timestamp value in the ``transaction'' section of the response.
