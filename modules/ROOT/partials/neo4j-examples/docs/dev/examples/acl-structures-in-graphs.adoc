ACL structures in graphs
========================

This example gives a generic overview of an approach to handling Access Control Lists (ACLs) in graphs,
and a simplified example with concrete queries.

== Generic approach ==

In many scenarios, an application needs to handle security on some form of managed
objects. This example describes one pattern to handle this through the use of a graph structure and traversers
that build a full permissions-structure for any managed object with exclude and include overriding
possibilities. This results in a dynamic construction of ACLs based on the
position and context of the managed object.

The result is a complex security scheme that can easily be implemented in a graph structure,
supporting permissions overriding, principal and content composition, without duplicating data anywhere.

=== Technique ===

As seen in the example graph layout, there are some key concepts in this domain model:

* The managed content (folders and files) that are connected by +HAS_CHILD_CONTENT+ relationships

* The Principal subtree pointing out principals that can act as ACL members, pointed out by the +PRINCIPAL+ relationships.

* The aggregation of principals into groups, connected by the +IS_MEMBER_OF+ relationship. One principal (user or group) can be part of many groups at the same time.

* The +SECURITY+ -- relationships, connecting the content composite structure to the principal composite structure, containing a addition/removal modifier property ("++RW+").


=== Constructing the ACL ===

The calculation of the effective permissions (e.g. Read, Write, Execute) for a
principal for any given ACL-managed node (content) follows a number of rules that will be encoded into the permissions-traversal:

=== Top-down-Traversal ===

This approach will let you define a generic permission pattern on the root content,
and then refine that for specific sub-content nodes and specific principals.

. Start at the content node in question traverse upwards to the content root node to determine the path to it.
. Start with a effective optimistic permissions list of "all permitted" (+111+ in a bit encoded ReadWriteExecute case)
  or +000+ if you like pessimistic security handling (everything is forbidden unless explicitly allowed).
. Beginning from the topmost content node, look for any +SECURITY+ relationships on it.
. If found, look if the principal in question is part of the end-principal of the +SECURITY+ relationship.
. If yes, add the "+++" permission modifiers to the existing permission pattern, revoke the "+-+" permission modifiers from the pattern.
. If two principal nodes link to the same content node, first apply the more generic prinipals modifiers.
. Repeat the security modifier search all the way down to the target content node, thus overriding more
  generic permissions with the set on nodes closer to the target node.

The same algorithm is applicable for the bottom-up approach, basically just
traversing from the target content node upwards and applying the security modifiers dynamically
as the traverser goes up.

=== Example ===

Now, to get the resulting access rights for e.g. "+user 1+" on the "+My File.pdf+" in a Top-Down
approach on the model in the graph above would go like:

. Traveling upward, we start with "+Root folder+", and set the permissions to +11+ initially (only considering Read, Write).
. There are two +SECURITY+ relationships to that folder.
  User 1 is contained in both of them, but "+root+" is more generic, so apply it first then "+All principals+" `+W` `+R` -> +11+.
. "+Home+" has no +SECURITY+ instructions, continue.
. "+user1 Home+" has +SECURITY+.
  First apply "+Regular Users+" (`-R` `-W`) -> +00+, Then "+user 1+" (`+R` `+W`) -> +11+.
. The target node "+My File.pdf+" has no +SECURITY+ modifiers on it, so the effective permissions for "+User 1+" on "+My File.pdf+" are +ReadWrite+ -> +11+.

== Read-permission example ==

In this example, we are going to examine a tree structure of +directories+ and
+files+. Also, there are users that own files and roles that can be assigned to
users. Roles can have permissions on directory or files structures (here we model
only +canRead+, as opposed to full +rwx+ Unix permissions) and be nested. A more thorough
example of modeling ACL structures can be found at

=== Find all files in the directory structure ===

In order to find all files contained in this structure, we need a variable length
query that follows all +contains+ relationships and retrieves the nodes at the other
end of the +leaf+ relationships.

include::includes/acl-structures-in-graphs-query1.adoc[]

resulting in:

include::includes/acl-structures-in-graphs-result1.adoc[]

=== What files are owned by whom? ===

If we introduce the concept of ownership on files, we then can ask for the owners of the files we find --
connected via +owns+ relationships to file nodes.

include::includes/acl-structures-in-graphs-query2.adoc[]

Returning the owners of all files below the +FileRoot+ node.

include::includes/acl-structures-in-graphs-result2.adoc[]


=== Who has access to a File? ===

If we now want to check what users have read access to all Files, and define our ACL as

* The root directory has no access granted.
* Any user having a role that has been granted +canRead+ access to one of the parent folders of a File has read access.

In order to find users that can read any part of the parent folder hierarchy above the files,
Cypher provides optional variable length path.

include::includes/acl-structures-in-graphs-query3.adoc[]

This will return the +file+, and the directory where the user has the +canRead+ permission along
with the +user+ and their +role+.

include::includes/acl-structures-in-graphs-result3.adoc[]

The results listed above contain +null+ for optional path segments, which can be mitigated by either asking several
queries or returning just the really needed values.
