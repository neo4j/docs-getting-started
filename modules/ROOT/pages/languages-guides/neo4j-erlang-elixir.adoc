[#community-drivers]
== Neo4j Community Drivers

Members of the each programming language community have invested a lot of time and love to develop each one of the community drivers for Neo4j, so if you use any one of them, please provide feedback to the authors.

====
[NOTE]
icon:users[size=2x]
The community drivers have been graciously contributed by the Neo4j community.
Many of them are fully featured and well-maintained, but some may not be.
Neo4j does not take any responsibility for their usability.

Members of the Erlang and Elixir community have invested a lot of time and love to develop these drivers, so if you use them, please provide feedback to the authors.

=== The Example Project

The Neo4j example project is a small, one page webapp for the movies database built into the Neo4j tutorial.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers: movie search, movie details, and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from each of the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers link:/developer/example-project[here^].
You will find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?q=movies[individual GitHub repositories^], which you can clone and deploy directly.

[#elixir-bolt]
== Elixir Bolt.Sips Driver

Neo4j driver for Elixir wrapped around the Bolt protocol.

.Features:
* It uses Bolt, Neo4j's standard network protocol, designed for high-performance
* Supports transactions, as well as simple and complex Cypher queries with or without parameters
* Connection pool implementation using "A hunky Erlang worker pool factory", aka: http://github.com/devinus/poolboy[Poolboy^] :)
* Supports Neo4j 3.0.x and forward

[#elixir-rest-wrapper]
== Neo4j.Sips

A simple Elixir wrapper around the Neo4j graph database REST API.
It aims to help Elixir developers to play with Neo4j and to eventually become the main support for a future https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto[Ecto^] adapter.
