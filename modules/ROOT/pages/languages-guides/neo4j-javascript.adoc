Neo4j provides drivers which allow you to make a connection to the database and develop applications
which create, read, update, and delete information from the graph.

You can use the official driver for JavaScript (neo4j-driver) or connect via HTTP using the `request` module or any of our community drivers.

In this free course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your Node.js projects.
You will learn about the Neo4j JavaScript Driver, how sessions and transactions work and how to query Neo4j from an existing application.

[#javascript-driver]
== Neo4j Javascript Driver


The Neo4j JavaScript driver is *officially supported* by Neo4j and connects to the database using the binary protocol.
It aims to be minimal, while being idiomatic to JavaScript, allowing you to subscribe to a stream of responses, errors and completion events.

[source, shell, subs=attributes,specialcharacters]
----
npm install neo4j-driver
----


[source, javascript, subs=attributes]
----
const neo4j = require('neo4j-driver')

    const driver = neo4j.driver(uri, neo4j.auth.basic(user, password))
    const session = driver.session()
    const personName = 'Alice'

    try {
      const result = await session.run(
        'CREATE (a:Person {name: $name}) RETURN a',
        { name: personName }
      )

      const singleRecord = result.records[0]
      const node = singleRecord.get(0)

      console.log(node.properties.name)
    } finally {
      await session.close()
    }

    // on application exit:
    await driver.close()

[#driver-configuration]
=== Driver Configuration

From Neo4j version **4.0** and onwards, the default encryption setting is *off* by default and Neo4j will no longer generate self-signed certificates.
This applies to default installations, installations through Neo4j Desktop and Docker images.
You can https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/current/upgrade-driver/#_configure_ssl_policy_for_bolt_server_and_https_server[verify the encryption level of your server^] by checking the `dbms.connector.bolt.enabled` key in `neo4j.conf`.

// tag::table[]
.Table Scheme Usage
|===
| Certificate Type | Neo4j Causal Cluster | Neo4j Standalone Server  | Direct Connection to Cluster Member

| *Unencrypted*
| `neo4j`
| `neo4j`
| `bolt`

| *Encrypted with Full Certificate*
| `neo4j+s`
| `neo4j+s`
| `bolt+s`


| *Encrypted with Self-Signed Certificate*
| `neo4j+ssc`

=== The Example Project

The Neo4j example project is a small, one page webapp for the movies database built into the Neo4j tutorial.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers: movie search, movie details, and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from each of the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers link:/developer/example-project[here^].
You will find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?q=movies[individual GitHub repositories^], which you can clone and deploy directly.

[#community-drivers]
== Neo4j Community Drivers

Members of the each programming language community have invested a lot of time and love to develop each one of the community drivers for Neo4j, so if you use any one of them, please provide feedback to the authors.

====
[NOTE]
icon:users[size=2x]
The community drivers have been graciously contributed by the Neo4j community.
Many of them are fully featured and well-maintained, but some may not be.
Neo4j does not take any responsibility for their usability.

=== js2neo

As a demonstration of a minimal JavaScript based bolt driver, Nigel Small put together https://js2neo.org/[js2neo^].

[#js-http-endpoint]
== Using the HTTP-Endpoint directly

You can use something as simple as the `request` node-module to send queries to and receive responses from Neo4j.
The endpoint protocol and formats are explained in detail in the link:/docs/http-api/current/introduction/[Neo4j Manual^].
It enables you do to much more, e.g. sending many statements per request or keeping transactions open across multiple requests.

Here is a very simple example:

.Simple Function Accessing the Remote Endpoint
[source, javascript]
----
var r=require("request");
var txUrl = "http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit";
function cypher(query,params,cb) {
  r.post({uri:txUrl,
          json:{statements:[{statement:query,parameters:params}]}},
         function(err,res) { cb(err,res.body)})
}
----

.Running the Function
[source, javascript]
----
var query="MATCH (n:User) RETURN n, labels(n) as l LIMIT {limit}"
var params={limit: 10}
var cb=function(err,data) { console.log(JSON.stringify(data)) }

cypher(query,params,cb)

{"results":[
  {"columns":["n","l"],
   "data":[
     {"row":[{"name":"Aran"},["User"]]}
    ]
  }],
 "errors":[]}
----
