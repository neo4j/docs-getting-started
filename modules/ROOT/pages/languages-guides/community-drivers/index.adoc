= Using Neo4j with Community Drivers
:description:
:examples: https://github.com/neo4j-examples

== Neo4j Community projects

In addition to the officially supported drivers, you can find their Community alternatives.
Links to their relevant resources are provided below.

Members of the each programming language community have invested a lot of time and love to develop each one of the community drivers for Neo4j, so if you use any one of them, provide feedback to the authors.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Community Drivers have been graciously contributed by the Neo4j community.
Many of them are fully featured and well-maintained, but some may not be.
Neo4j does not take any responsibility for their usability.

[[dotnet-community-drivers]]
=== .NET Community drivers


[#neo4jclient-lib]
==== Neo4jClient

A .NET client for Neo4j, which makes it easy to write Cypher queries in C# with IntelliSense.
It also supports basic CRUD and legacy indexing.

[[javascript-community-drivers]]
=== JavaScript Community drivers


[#js2neo-lib]
==== js2neo

As a demonstration of a minimal JavaScript based bolt driver, Nigel Small put together https://js2neo.org/[js2neo^].

[[python-community-drivers]]
=== Python Community drivers

For anyone working with https://www.python.org/[Python^], the Neo4j community have contributed a range of driver options.
These range from lightweight to comprehensive driver packages as well as libraries designed for use with web frameworks such as https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^].

While Python 3 is preferred, some drivers still support Python 2, thus check with the individual project if you need it.

While we do not provide a specific web framework recommendation, both the lightweight http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask^] and the more comprehensive https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^] frameworks are known to work well.

[#py2neo-lib]
==== Py2neo

Py2neo is a client library and comprehensive toolkit for working with Neo4j from within Python applications and from the command line.
It has been carefully designed to be easy and intuitive to use.
