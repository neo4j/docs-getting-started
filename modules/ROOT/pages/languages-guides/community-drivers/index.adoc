== Introduction

In addition to the officially supported drivers, you can find their Community alternatives.
Besides Java, .NET, JavaScript, Go, and Python drivers, Neo4j Community offers support for Ruby, PHP, Perl, and Rust.
Links to their relevant resources are provided below.

Members of the each programming language community have invested a lot of time and love to develop each one of the community drivers for Neo4j, so if you use any one of them, please provide feedback to the authors.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Community drivers have been graciously contributed by the Neo4j community.
Many of them are fully featured and well-maintained, but some may not be.
Neo4j does not take any responsibility for their usability.

[[neo4j-ruby]]
== Using Neo4j from Ruby

[#neo4jrb-lib]
=== Neo4j.rb

The link:http://neo4jrb.io/[Neo4j.rb project^] is made up of the following Ruby gems:

neo4j-ruby-driver::
A Neo4j driver for Ruby with an API consistent with the official drivers.
It is based on Seabolt and FFI.
Available on all rubies (including JRuby) and all platforms supported by Seabolt.
neo4j-java-driver::
A Neo4j driver for Ruby based on the official Java implementation.
It provides a thin wrapper over the Java driver (only
in JRuby).
activegraph::
A Object-Graph-Mapper (OGM) for the Neo4j graph database.
It tries to follow API conventions established by ActiveRecord but with a Neo4j flavor.
It requires one of the above drivers.
neo4j-rake_tasks::
A set of rake tasks for installing and managing a Neo4j database within your project.

[[neo4j-php]]
== Using Neo4j from PHP

Alternatively, Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its Bolt and HTTP APIs.
We recommend the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client#roadmap[Neo4j PHP client^] for easiest development over Bolt and HTTP APIs.
You can also directly access the Bolt protocol via the https://github.com/stefanak-michal/Bolt[PHP Bolt] library.

[#Client]
=== Neo4j PHP client

*Neo4j PHP client* is a client supporting multiple protocols. 
*HTTP* and *Bolt* are supported, starting from Neo4j 3.5 up until the most recent version.

It is being actively developed.
For more details, refer to a README file on the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client[Github page^].
