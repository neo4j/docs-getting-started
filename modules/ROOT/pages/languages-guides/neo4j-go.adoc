= Using Neo4j from Go
:tags: golang, go, app-development, applications
:description: If you are a Go developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j. While this guide is not comprehensive it will introduce the different drivers and link to the relevant resources.

You should be familiar with xref:reference/graphdb-concepts/index.adoc[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.

== Neo4j for Go Developers

Neo4j provides drivers which allow you to make a connection to the database and develop applications
which create, read, update, and delete information from the graph.

[#go-driver]
== Neo4j Go Driver


The Neo4j Go driver is *officially supported* by Neo4j and connects to the database using the binary bolt protocol.
It aims to be minimal, while being idiomatic to Go.

=== Module version
Make sure your application has been set up to use go modules (there should be a `go.mod` file in your application root). Add the driver with:

[source, shell, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5
----

If you need to pin a specific https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/tags[*5.x* version], you can run this instead:
----
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5@<5.x tag>
----

where `<5.x tag>` is one of the available tag (e.g.: `v5.3.0`).

[source, go, subs="attributes"]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v{go-driver-version}/neo4j/test-integration/examples_test.go[tag=hello-world,indent=0]
----

[#driver-configuration]
=== Driver Configuration

From Neo4j version **4.0** and onwards, the default encryption setting is *off* by default and Neo4j will no longer generate self-signed certificates.
This applies to default installations, installations through Neo4j Desktop and Docker images.
You can https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/current/upgrade-driver/#_configure_ssl_policy_for_bolt_server_and_https_server[verify the encryption level of your server^] by checking the `dbms.connector.bolt.enabled` key in `neo4j.conf`.

=== The Example Project

The Neo4j example project is a small, one page webapp for the Movies database built into the Neo4j tutorial.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers: movie search, movie details, and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from each of the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers xref:reference/example-data.adoc[here].
You can find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?q=movies[individual GitHub repositories^], which you can clone and deploy directly.
