While this guide is not comprehensive it introduces the different drivers and links to the relevant resources.

You should be familiar with xref:appendix/graphdb-concepts/index.adoc[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:{aura_signup}[created an Neo4j AuraDB cloud instance], or link:/download/[installed Neo4j locally]
When developing with Neo4j, please use Java 8 or 11 and your favorite IDE.

Alternatively, Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its bolt and HTTP APIs. We recommend the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client#roadmap[PHP Client^] for easiest development over bolt and HTTP APIs. You can also directly access the bolt protocol via the https://github.com/stefanak-michal/Bolt[PHP Bolt] library.


[#community-drivers]
== Neo4j Community Drivers

Members of the each programming language community have invested a lot of time and love to develop each one of the community drivers for Neo4j, so if you use any one of them, please provide feedback to the authors.

====
[NOTE]
icon:users[size=2x]
The community drivers have been graciously contributed by the Neo4j community.
Many of them are fully featured and well-maintained, but some may not be.
Neo4j does not take any responsibility for their usability.

[#Client]
== Full client

*Neo4j-php-client* is a client supporting multiple protocols. *Http* and *bolt* are supported, starting from neo4j 3.5 up until the most recent version.

It boasts many features such as multiple connections, transactions functions, authentication and auto-routing. It also integrates with the psalm static analysis tool for complete type safety.

It is being actively developed and has a big readme file on the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client[Github page^].
