{description}
While this guide is not comprehensive, it will introduce some prominent drivers and link to the relevant resources.

You should be familiar with xref:appendix/graphdb-concepts/index.adoc[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:{aura_signup}[created an Neo4j AuraDB cloud instance], or link:/download/[installed Neo4j locally]

[#community-drivers]
== Neo4j Community Drivers

Members of the each programming language community have invested a lot of time and love to develop each one of the community drivers for Neo4j, so if you use any one of them, please provide feedback to the authors.

[NOTE]
====
icon:users[size=2x]
The community drivers have been graciously contributed by the Neo4j community.
Many of them are fully featured and well-maintained, but some may not be.
Neo4j does not take any responsibility for their usability.

[#neo4j-perl]
== Neo4j for Perl developers

// image::{neo4j-img-base-uri}perl.png[float=right]

Members of the Perl community have invested a lot of time and love to develop drivers for Neo4j, so if you use them, please provide feedback to the authors.

=== The Example Project

The Neo4j example project is a small, one page webapp for the movies database built into the Neo4j tutorial.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers: movie search, movie details, and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from each of the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers link:/developer/example-project[here^].
You will find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?q=movies[individual GitHub repositories^], which you can clone and deploy directly.

[#neo4p-rest]
== REST::Neo4p

This Perl driver from Mark Jensen works with Neo4jâ€™s REST API by using Perl5 objects in a consistent, idiomatic Perl-style.  There is also a related DBI-compliant wrapper (https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::Neo4p[DBD::Neo4p])

[#neo4j-driver]
== Neo4j::Driver

This is a Perl driver by Arne Johannessen. It enables interacting with a Neo4j server using the same classes and method calls as the official Neo4j drivers.  It also has (currently experimental) support for HTTPS and Bolt.

[#neo4j-bolt]
== Neo4j::Bolt

This is another driver from Mark Jensen. It's implemented as a Perl wrapper around the libneo4j-client C library, which implements the Bolt network protocol.
