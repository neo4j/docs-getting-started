{description}

You should be familiar with xref:appendix/graphdb-concepts/index.adoc[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:{aura_signup}[created an Neo4j AuraDB cloud instance], or link:/download/[installed Neo4j locally].

[#neo4j-python]
== Neo4j and Python

// image::{neo4j-img-base-uri}python-logo.png[width=300,float="right"]

Neo4j provides drivers which allow you to make a connection to the database and develop applications
which create, read, update, and delete information from the graph.

=== link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-python/?ref=guides[Building Neo4j Applications with Python^]

In this free course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your Python projects.
You will learn about the Neo4j Python Driver, how sessions and transactions work and how to query Neo4j from an existing application.

[#python-driver]
== Neo4j Python Driver


The Neo4j Python driver is *officially supported* by Neo4j and connects to the database using the binary protocol.
It aims to be minimal, while being idiomatic to Python.

IMPORTANT: Support for Python 2 was removed in the 2.0 release of the driver.

[#driver-configuration]
=== Driver configuration

From Neo4j version **4.0** and onwards, the default encryption setting is *off* by default and Neo4j will no longer generate self-signed certificates.
This applies to default installations, installations through Neo4j Desktop and Docker images.
You can https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/current/upgrade-driver/#_configure_ssl_policy_for_bolt_server_and_https_server[verify the encryption level of your server^] by checking the `dbms.connector.bolt.enabled` key in `neo4j.conf`.

// tag::table[]
.Table Scheme Usage
|===
| Certificate Type | Neo4j Causal Cluster | Neo4j Standalone Server  | Direct Connection to Cluster Member

| *Unencrypted*
| `neo4j`
| `neo4j`
| `bolt`

| *Encrypted with Full Certificate*
| `neo4j+s`
| `neo4j+s`
| `bolt+s`


| *Encrypted with Self-Signed Certificate*
| `neo4j+ssc`
| `neo4j+ssc`

=== The Example project

The Neo4j example project is a small, one page webapp for the movies database built into the Neo4j tutorial.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers: movie search, movie details, and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from each of the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers link:/developer/example-project[here^].
You will find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?q=movies[individual GitHub repositories^], which you can clone and deploy directly.

[#community-drivers]
== Neo4j Community drivers

Members of the each programming language community have invested a lot of time and love to develop each one of the community drivers for Neo4j, so if you use any one of them, please provide feedback to the authors.

====
[NOTE]
icon:users[size=2x]
The community drivers have been graciously contributed by the Neo4j community.
Many of them are fully featured and well-maintained, but some may not be.
Neo4j does not take any responsibility for their usability.
====

For anyone working with https://www.python.org/[Python^], the Neo4j community have contributed a range of driver options.
These range from lightweight to comprehensive driver packages as well as libraries designed for use with web frameworks such as https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^].

While Python 3 is preferred, some drivers still support Python 2, thus check with the individual project if you need it.

While we do not provide a specific web framework recommendation, both the lightweight http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask^] and the more comprehensive https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^] frameworks are known to work well.

[#py2neo-lib]
=== Py2neo

// image::{neo4j-img-base-uri}py2neo.200x200.png[float="right",width=100]

Py2neo is a client library and comprehensive toolkit for working with Neo4j from within Python applications and from the command line.
It has been carefully designed to be easy and intuitive to use.
