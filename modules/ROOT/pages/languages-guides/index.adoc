Neo4j supports several libraries, protocols, and APIs that you can use to create an application.
This page lists the officially supported options.

== Libraries

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always use the latest version of the library.
The latest 5.x drivers support connection to any Neo4j 5 and 4.4 instance, and will also be compatible with Neo4j 6.

[#bolt-protocol]
== Bolt Protocol

The binary protocol link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/[Bolt] is based on the PackStream serialization and supports the Cypher type system, protocol versioning, authentication, and TLS via certificates.
For Neo4j Clusters, Bolt provides smart client routing with load balancing and failover.

The binary protocol is enabled in Neo4j by default, so you can use any language library that supports it.
For more details, refer to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/[Bolt documentation].

[#query-api]
== APIs

Neo4j supports the following APIs:

* *link:{docs-home}/http-api/[HTTP API] (_Not available on Aura_) and link:{docs-home}/query-api[Query API]* -> allow executing Cypher statements against a Neo4j server through HTTP requests.
The main use case of these APIs is for developing client applications in languages for which there is no supported library.
* link:{docs-home}/cdc[Change Data Capture] -> allows capturing and tracking changes to your database in real-time, enabling you to keep your other data sources up to date with Neo4j.
