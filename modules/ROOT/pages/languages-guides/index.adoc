[#query-api]
== APIs

Neo4j supports the following APIs:

* *link:{docs-home}/http-api/[HTTP API] (_Not available on Aura_) and link:{docs-home}/query-api[Query API]* -> allow executing Cypher statements against a Neo4j server through HTTP requests.
The main use case of these APIs is for developing client applications in languages for which there is no supported library.
* link:{docs-home}/cdc[Change Data Capture] -> allows capturing and tracking changes to your database in real-time, enabling you to keep your other data sources up to date with Neo4j.
