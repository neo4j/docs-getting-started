[#neo4j-app-dev]
== Neo4j language guides
This section is designed to provide detailed examples of how to integrate Neo4j with your preferred programming language.
Neo4j *officially supports the drivers for .Net, Java, JavaScript, Go, and Python* for the binary Bolt protocol.
Our community contributors provide drivers for all major programming languages for all protocols and APIs.
In this section, we provide an introduction and a consistent example application for several languages and Neo4j drivers.

You should be familiar with xref:appendix/graphdb-concepts/index.adoc[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:{aura_signup}[created an Neo4j AuraDB cloud instance], or link:/download/[installed Neo4j locally].


[#connect-neo4j]
== How to connect to Neo4j?

If you've created an link:{aura_signup}[AuraDB instance^], or link:/download/[installed] and started Neo4j as a server on your system,
you can already work interactively with the database via the built-in Neo4j Browser, which you find in the AuraDB console, or if you're running locally, on http://localhost:7474[localhost:7474].

To build an application, you want to connect to Neo4j from your technology stack.
Fortunately it is very easy using a driver which connects to Neo4j via Bolt or HTTP.

[#bolt-protocol]
== The binary Bolt Protocol

Starting with Neo4j 3.0 we support a binary protocol called Bolt.
It is based on the PackStream serialization and supports the Cypher type system, protocol versioning, authentication and TLS via certificates.
For Neo4j Clusters, Bolt provides smart client routing with load balancing and failover.

The binary protocol is enabled in Neo4j by default, so you can use any language driver that supports it.

Neo4j officially provides drivers for

_For more details on the protocol implementation, see the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/boltkit[implementers documentation^]._

[#neo4j-drivers]
== All Neo4j Drivers

Thanks to the Neo4j contributor community, there are additionally drivers for almost every popular programming language,
most of which mimic existing database driver idioms and approaches.
Get started with your stack now, see the dedicated page for more detail.

If you are new to development, we recommend the https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html[Jetbrains IDE^] for a good developer experience, which also comes with a link:/blog/jetbrains-ide-plugin-graph-database/[Neo4j Database plugin^].

To demonstrate connection to and usage of Neo4j in different programming languages we've created an example application.
It is a http://my-neo4j-movies-app.herokuapp.com/[simple, one-page webapp^], that uses Neo4j's movie demo database (movie, actor, director) as data set.
The same front-end web page in all applications consumes three REST endpoints provided by backend implemented in the different programming languages and drivers:

* movie search by title
* single movie listing
* graph visualization of the domain


[#app-project-source]
== GitHub

The source code for all the different language examples is available on https://github.com/neo4j-examples?query=movies[GitHub^] as individual repositories that can be cloned and directly used as starting points.


[#http-api]
== Using the HTTP API

[NOTE]
--
The HTTP API is available in Community Edition and Enterprise Edition, but not in AuraDB.
--

If you want to access Neo4j programmatically, you can also use the HTTP-API which allow you to:

* POST one or more Cypher statements with parameters.
* Keep transactions open over multiple requests.
* Choose different result formats.

Let's look at one of the underlying remote API endpoint that Neo4j offers to run queries.
These APIs can be then used directly via a HTTP library or a driver for your language.

A simple HTTP Cypher request, executable in the Neo4j Browser, would look like this:

[source, json]
----
:POST /db/data/transaction/commit {"statements":[
      {"statement":"CREATE (p:Person {firstName: $name}) RETURN p",
       "parameters":{"name":"Daniel"}}
    ]}
----

Some of the language drivers use the HTTP API under the hood, but make them available in a more convenient way.
