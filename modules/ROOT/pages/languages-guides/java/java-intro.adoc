:description: If you are a Java developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j.

[abstract]
{description}
While this guide is not comprehensive, it introduces the different APIs and links to the relevant resources.

[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/graphdb-concepts/[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:{aura_signup}[created an Neo4j AuraDB cloud instance], or link:/download/[installed Neo4j locally].
When developing with Neo4j, please use Java 8 or 11 and your favorite IDE.


[#neo4j-java]
== Neo4j for Java developers

// image::{img}java.jpg[float=right,width=200]

Neo4j provides drivers which allow you to make a connection to the database and develop applications
which create, read, update, and delete information from the graph.

For Community Edition and Enterprise Edition, you can also extend Neo4j by implementing *user defined procedures for Cypher* in Java or other JVM languages.

// ****
// [NOTE]
// Please note the minimum version compatibilities: +
// Neo4j Server 3.x - Java 8 +
// Neo4j Server 4.x - Java 11
// ****

=== The Example Project

The Neo4j example project is a small, one page webapp for the movies database built into the Neo4j tutorial.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers: movie search, movie details, and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from each of the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers link:/developer/example-project[here^].
You will find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?q=movies[individual GitHub repositories^], which you can clone and deploy directly.


[#java-driver]
== Neo4j Java Driver


The Neo4j Java driver is *officially supported* by Neo4j and connects to the database using the binary protocol.
It aims to be minimal, while being idiomatic to Java.
We support Java 8 and 11 for the driver.

When using Maven, add this to your _pom.xml_ file:

[source, xml, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
<groupId>org.neo4j.driver</groupId>
<artifactId>neo4j-java-driver</artifactId>
<version>{java-driver-version}</version>
----

For Gradle or Grails, this is how to add the dependency:

[source, groovy, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
compile 'org.neo4j.driver:neo4j-java-driver:{java-driver-version}'
----

For other build systems, see {maven-artifact-info}[information available at Maven Central].

[#driver-configuration]
=== Driver configuration

From Neo4j version **4.0** and onwards, the default encryption setting is *off* and Neo4j no longer generates self-signed certificates.
This applies to default installations, installations through Neo4j Desktop and Docker images.
You can https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/current/upgrade-driver/#_configure_ssl_policy_for_bolt_server_and_https_server[verify the encryption level of your server^] by checking the `dbms.connector.bolt.enabled` key in `neo4j.conf`.

// tag::table[]
.Table Scheme Usage
|===
| Certificate Type | Neo4j Causal Cluster | Neo4j Standalone Server  | Direct Connection to Cluster Member

| *Unencrypted*
| `neo4j`
| `neo4j`
| `bolt`

| *Encrypted with Full Certificate*
| `neo4j+s`
| `neo4j+s`
| `bolt+s`


| *Encrypted with Self-Signed Certificate*
| `neo4j+ssc`
| `neo4j+ssc`
| `bolt+ssc`
