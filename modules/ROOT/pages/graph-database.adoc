A Neo4j graph database stores data as <<nodes>>, <<relationships>>, and <<properties>> instead of in tables or documents.
This means you can organize your data in a similar way as when sketching ideas on a whiteboard.

And since graph databases are not restricted to a pre-defined model, you can take more flexible approaches and strategies when working with them.

== How it works

Graph databases are structured through nodes and relationships.

*Nodes* are entities in the graph which can:

* Be tagged with <<labels>> representing their different roles in a domain (e.g., `Person`).
* Hold any number of link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/[key-value pairs] as properties (e.g., `name`).
* Be <<indexed>> and bound by <<constraints>>.

*Relationships* provide named connections between two nodes (e.g., _Person_ - `LOVES` - _Person_) and they:

* Must always have a start node, an end node, and exactly one type.
* Must have a direction.
* Can have properties, like nodes.
* Nodes can have multiple relationships of various types without sacrificing performance.

In summary, nodes and relationships are an efficient and flexible way to store data since they allow you to:

* Create traversals in big graphs for both depth and breadth.
* Scale-up your database to billions of nodes.
* Design flexible property graph data models that can adapt over time.

[[why-graphdb]]
== Why use a graph database

Projects often deal with large amounts of complex data and graph databases can be a powerful tool.

There are other ways to store data as objects and connections, such as relational databases, for example.
However, relational databases use computing-wise expensive `JOIN` operations or cross-looks, which are often tied to a rigid data model.

Graph databases do not use JOINs.
Rather, relationships are stored natively alongside the data elements (nodes) in a more flexible format, which allows the optimization of data traversing and millions of connections to be accessed per second.

Moreover, many daily challenges and tasks can be viewed from a graph perspective as it allows you to:

* Navigate deep hierarchies.
* Find hidden connections between distant items.
* Discover inter-relationships between items.

== How to use

Whether it's a social or a road network, all networks can be structured as an interconnected graph of relationships. 
Many times, a project's questions and challenges revolve around the relationship between elements, not the elements themselves (e.g. how to get from A to B, instead of what A is and what B is).
For this reason, graphs can be applied to many areas of society and to a wide variety of projects.

Neo4j is frequently used today by https://neo4j.com/customers/[startups, educational institutions, and large enterprises] in a variety of sectors including financial services, government, energy, technology, retail, and manufacturing.
Graphs have been successful in helping them on the development of innovative new technology, business management, insight and revenue regenration, as well as overall improvements in efficiency.
