== Introduction

We offer graph algorithms library - Graph Data Science.
We have cloud sevice -- AuraDS
?? Is AuraDS for work in team? how to share your workflow or results with other team members? Collaborate

== Setting up the environment

* Sandbox: https://neo4j.com/sandbox/?ref=developer-graph-algo -- ask Adam
* Cloud option - AuraDS 
* Locally - GDS as a plugin in Neo4j Desktop:
** Community Edition and Enterprise Edition



If you are Python oriented person, go to the Client docs.
very short instruction on how to get started with client



examples in Jupiter notebook - links to Client docs, AuraDS docs.
