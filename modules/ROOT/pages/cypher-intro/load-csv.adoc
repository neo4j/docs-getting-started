= Tutorial: Import data


This tutorial demonstrates how to import data from CSV files using `LOAD CSV`.


With the combination of the Cypher clauses `LOAD CSV`, `MERGE`, and `CREATE` you can import data into Neo4j.
`LOAD CSV` allows you to access the data values and perform actions on them.

[NOTE]
====
* For a full description of `LOAD CSV` , see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv#query-load-csv[Cypher Manual -> `LOAD CSV`].
* For a full list of Cypher clauses, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses#query-clause[Cypher Manual -> Clauses].
====


== The data files

In this tutorial, you import data from the following CSV files:

* _persons.csv_
* _movies.csv_
* _roles.csv_


The content of the _persons.csv_ file:

.persons.csv
[source]
----
id,name
1,Charlie Sheen
2,Michael Douglas
3,Martin Sheen
4,Morgan Freeman
----

The _persons.csv_ file contains two columns `id` and `name`.
Each row represents one person that has a unique `id` and a `name`.


The content of the _movies.csv_ file:

.movies.csv
[source]
----
id,title,country,year
1,Wall Street,USA,1987
2,The American President,USA,1995
3,The Shawshank Redemption,USA,1994
----

The _movies.csv_ file contains the columns `id`, `title`, `country`, and `year`.
Each row represents one movie that has a unique `id`, a `title`, a `country` of origin, and a release `year`.


The content of the _roles.csv_ file:

.roles.csv
[source]
----
personId,movieId,role
1,1,Bud Fox
3,1,Carl Fox
2,1,Gordon Gekko
3,2,A.J. MacInerney
2,2,President Andrew Shepherd
4,3,Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding
----

The _roles.csv_ file contains the columns `personId`, `movieId`, and `role`.
Each row represents one role with relationship data about the person `id` (from the _persons.csv_ file) and the movie `id` (from the _movies.csv_ file).


== The graph model

The following data model shows what a graph model for this dataset could look like:

image::getting-started-load-csv01-arr.svg[role="middle"]


This is the resulting graph, based on the data from the CSV files:

image::getting-started-load-csv02-arr.svg[role="middle"]

== Prerequisites

This tutorial uses the Linux or macOS tarball installation.

It assumes that your current work directory is the _<neo4j-home>_ directory of the tarball installation, and the CSV files are placed in the default _import_ directory.


[TIP]
====
* For the default directory of other installations see, link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/configuration/file-locations#file-locations[Operations Manual -> File locations].
* The import location can be configured with link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings#config_dbms.directories.import[Operations Manual -> `server.directories.import`].

== Prepare the database

Before importing the data, you should prepare the database you want to use by creating indexes and constraints.

You should ensure that the `Person` and `Movie` nodes have unique `id` properties by creating constraints on them.

Creating a unique constraint also implicitly creates an index.
By indexing the `id` property, node lookup (e.g. by `MATCH`) will be much faster.

Additionally, it is a good idea to index the country `name` for a fast lookup.


**+1.+ Start neo4j.**

Run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/neo4j start
----

[NOTE]
====
The default user name is `neo4j` and password `neo4j`.
====


**+2.+ Create a constraint so that each `Person` node has a unique `id` property.**

You create a constraint on the `id` property of `Person` nodes to ensure that nodes with the `Person` label will have a unique `id` property.

Using _Neo4j Browser_, run the following Cypher:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT personIdConstraint FOR (person:Person) REQUIRE person.id IS UNIQUE
----

Or using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell[_Neo4j Cypher Shell_], run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j "CREATE CONSTRAINT personIdConstraint FOR (person:Person) REQUIRE person.id IS UNIQUE"
----

**+3.+ Create a constraint so that each `Movie` node has a unique `id` propery.**

You create a constraint on the `id` property of `Movie` nodes to ensure that nodes with the `Movie` label will have a unique `id` property.

Using _Neo4j Browser_, run the following Cypher:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT movieIdConstraint FOR (movie:Movie) REQUIRE movie.id IS UNIQUE
----

Or using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell[_Neo4j Cypher Shell_], run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j "CREATE CONSTRAINT movieIdConstraint FOR (movie:Movie) REQUIRE movie.id IS UNIQUE"
----

**+4.+ Create an index for `Country` node for the `name` property.**

Create an index on the `name` property of `Country` nodes to ensure fast lookups.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using `MERGE` or `MATCH` with `LOAD CSV`, make sure you have an xref::/cypher-intro/schema.adoc#cypher-intro-indexes[index] or a xref::/cypher-intro/schema.adoc#cypher-intro-constraints[unique constraint] on the property that you are merging on.
This will ensure that the query executes in a performant way.
====

Using _Neo4j Browser_, run the following Cypher:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CREATE INDEX FOR (c:Country) ON (c.name)
----

Or using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell[_Neo4j Cypher Shell_], run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j "CREATE INDEX FOR (c:Country) ON (c.name)"
----


== Import data using `LOAD CSV`


**+1.+ Load the data from the _persons.csv_ file.**

You create nodes with the `Person` label and the properties `id` and `name`.

Using _Neo4j Browser_, run the following Cypher:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///persons.csv" AS csvLine
CREATE (p:Person {id: toInteger(csvLine.id), name: csvLine.name})
----

Or using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell[_Neo4j Cypher Shell_], run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j 'LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///persons.csv" AS csvLine CREATE (p:Person {id:toInteger(csvLine.id), name:csvLine.name})'
----

Output:

[source]
----
Added 4 nodes, Set 8 properties, Added 4 labels
----

[TIP]
====
`LOAD CSV` also supports accessing CSV files via `HTTPS`, `HTTP`, and `FTP`, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv#query-load-csv[Cypher Manual -> `LOAD CSV`].
====

**+2.+ Load the data from the _movies.csv_ file.**

You create nodes with the `Movie` label and the properties `id`, `title`, and `year`.

Also you create nodes with the `Country` label.
Using `MERGE` avoids creating duplicate `Country` nodes in the case where multiple movies have the same country of origin.

The relationship with the type `ORIGIN` will connect the `Country` node and the `Movie` node.

Using _Neo4j Browser_, run the following Cypher:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///movies.csv" AS csvLine
MERGE (country:Country {name: csvLine.country})
CREATE (movie:Movie {id: toInteger(csvLine.id), title: csvLine.title, year:toInteger(csvLine.year)})
CREATE (movie)-[:ORIGIN]->(country)
----

Or using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell[_Neo4j Cypher Shell_], run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j 'LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///movies.csv" AS csvLine MERGE (country:Country {name:csvLine.country}) CREATE (movie:Movie {id:toInteger(csvLine.id), title:csvLine.title, year:toInteger(csvLine.year)}) CREATE (movie)-[:ORIGIN]->(country)'
----

Output:

[source]
----
Added 4 nodes, Created 3 relationships, Set 10 properties, Added 4 labels
----

[[call-in-transactions]]
**+3.+ Load the data from the _roles.csv_ file**

Importing the data from the _roles.csv_ file is a matter of finding the `Person` node and the `Movie` node and then creating relationships between them.

[TIP]
====
For larger data files, good practice is to use the subquery `CALL {...} IN TRANSACTIONS`.
This subquery tells Neo4j that the query might build up inordinate amounts of transaction state, and thus needs to be committed in batches.
For more information, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/call-subquery/[Cypher Manual -> CALL {} (subquery)].
====

Using _Neo4j Browser_, run the following Cypher:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
:auto LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///roles.csv' AS csvLine
CALL {
 WITH csvLine
 MATCH (person:Person {id: toInteger(csvLine.personId)}), (movie:Movie {id: toInteger(csvLine.movieId)})
CREATE (person)-[:ACTED_IN {role: csvLine.role}]->(movie)
} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 2 ROWS
----

Using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell[_Cypher Shell_], you can run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j 'LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///roles.csv" AS csvLine CALL {MATCH (person:Person {id: toInteger(csvLine.personId)}), (movie:Movie {id: toInteger(csvLine.movieId)}) CREATE (person)-[:ACTED_IN {role: csvLine.role}]->(movie)} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 2 ROWS'
----

Output:

[source]
----
Created 5 relationships, Set 5 properties
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note, `CALL {...} IN TRANSACTIONS` is only allowed in _implicit_ transactions.
Cypher Shell supports both explicit and implicit transactions.
However, in Browser you need to prepend `CALL {...} IN TRANSACTIONS` with `:auto`.
For more details, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/call-subquery/#subquery-call-in-transactions[Cypher manual -> Subqueries in transactions] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/browser-manual/current/reference-commands/[Neo4j Browser Guide -> Command reference].
====

== Validate the imported data

Check the resulting data set by finding all the nodes that have a relationship.

Using _Neo4j Browser_, run the following Cypher:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m
----

Or using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell[_Neo4j Cypher Shell_], run the command:

[source, shell, indent=0]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j 'MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m'
----

Output:
