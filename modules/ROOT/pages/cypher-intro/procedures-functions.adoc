This guide explains how to create, use and deploy user-defined procedures and functions, the extension mechanism of Cypher, Neo4j's query language.

[#cypher-extension]
== Extending Cypher

Cypher is a powerful and expressive language, with first class graph pattern and collection support.
But sometimes you need to do more than it currently offers, like additional graph algorithms, parallelization, or custom conversions.

Cypher can be extended with _User-defined procedures and functions_, as described in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/procedures/[Java Reference -> User-defined procedures] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/functions/[Java Reference -> User-defined functions]. 

Neo4j itself provides and utilizes custom procedures.
Many of the monitoring, introspection and security features exposed by *Neo4j Browser* are implemented using procedures.

[#procedures-functions]
== Procedures and functions in Neo4j

* Functions are simple computations / conversions and return a single value.
* Functions can be used in any expression or predicate.

* Procedures are more complex operations and generate streams of results.
* To check which procedures are available in your Neo4j DBMS, use the Cypher command `SHOW PROCEDURES`.
* Procedures can generate, fetch, or compute data to make it available to later processing steps in your Cypher query.

[#cypher-list-extension]
== Listing and using functions and procedures in Neo4j

There are a number of built-in procedures in Neo4j.
To learn more about them, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/procedures/[Operations Manual -> Procedures].

To list all available functions and procedures, use the following Cypher commands:

* `SHOW FUNCTIONS`
* `SHOW PROCEDURES`

You can refer to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-cheat-sheet/current/[Cypher Cheat Sheet] to get a quick reference on how to use these commands.

Also take a look at the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/[procedure section in the Neo4j Java Reference^].

Each procedure returns one or more columns of data.
With `YIELD` clause these columns can be selected and also aliased and are then available in your Cypher statement.

[source,cypher]
----
SHOW PROCEDURES
YIELD name, signature, description as text
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'db.'
RETURN * ORDER BY name ASC
----

Of course, you can process the result columns with other Cypher clauses and group the results.

User-defined functions are written in Java, deployed into the database and are called in the same way as any other Cypher functions. 
There are two main types of functions that can be developed and used:

* user-defined scalar functions,
* user-defined aggregation functions.

For more details, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/user-defined/[Cypher Manual -> User-defined functions].

You can take any procedure library and deploy it to your server to make additional procedures and functions available.

Also take a look at the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/[procedure section in the Neo4j Java Reference^].

[#deploy-extension]
== Deploying procedures and functions

If you build your own procedures or download them from a community project, they are packaged in a JAR file.
You can copy that file into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory of your Neo4j server and restart.

You can take any procedure library and deploy it to your server to make additional procedures and functions available.

[WARNING]
====
As procedures and functions use the low level Java API they can access all Neo4j internals as well as the file system and machine.
That's why you should know which procedures you deploy and why.
Only install procedures from trusted sources.
If they are open source, check their source-code and best build them yourself.

See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/securing-extensions/[Operations Manual -> Securing extensions] for best practices on how to ensure the security of these additions.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Certain procedures and functions are available for self-managed Neo4j Enterprise Edition and Community Edition. 
Custom code described in this section is not compatible with link:{aura_signup}[AuraDB].

== Procedure and function gallery

link:https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/introduction/[The APOC Core library] offers you a set of useful procedures on Cypher to increase functionality in areas of data integration, graph algorithms and data conversion.

////
A procedure to load data from another database:

[source,cypher]
-----
WITH "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/northwind?user=root" as url
CALL apoc.load.jdbc(url,"products") YIELD row
RETURN row
ORDER BY row.UnitPrice DESC
LIMIT 20
-----

////

For example, functions to format and parse timestamps of different resolutions:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.date.format(timestamp()) as time,
       apoc.date.format(timestamp(),'ms','yyyy-MM-dd') as date,
       apoc.date.parse('13.01.1975','s','dd.MM.yyyy') as unixtime,
       apoc.date.parse('2017-01-05 13:03:07') as millis
----

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|time                 |date        |unixtime  |millis
|"2017-01-05 13:06:39"|"2017-01-05"|158803200 |1483621387000
|===

In our link:https://neo4j.com/labs/[Neo4j Labs projects], you can find a set of libraries built by our community and staff.
Check it out to see what's already there.
Many of your needs will already be covered by those, for example:

* index operations
* database/api integration
* graph refactorings
* import and export
* spatial index lookup
* rdf import and export
* and many more

[NOTE]
====
Community projects are not supported officially and we donâ€™t provide any SLAs or guarantees around backwards compatibility and deprecation.

[#custom-extension]
== Developing your own procedures and functions

You can find details on writing and testing procedures in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/procedures-and-functions/introduction/[Neo4j Java Reference^].  

The https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-procedure-template[example GitHub repository^] contains detailed documentation and comments that you can clone directly and use as a starting point.

Here are just some initial tips.

User-defined functions are simpler, so let's start with them:

* `@UserFunction` are annotated, public Java methods in a class
* their default name is package-name.method-name
* they return a single value
* are read only

User-defined procedures are similar:

* `@Procedure` annotated, Java methods
* with an additional `mode` attribute (`READ, WRITE, DBMS`)
* return a Java 8 `Stream` of simple objects with `public` fields
* these fields names are turned into result columns available for `YIELD`

These things are valid for both:

* take `@Name` annotated parameters (with optional default values)
* can use an injected `@Context public GraphDatabaseService`
* run within transaction of the Cypher statement
* supported types for parameters and results are: `Long, Double, Boolean, String, Node, Relationship, Path, Object`
