Neo4j is a _native graph database_, which means that it implements a true <<graph>> model all the way down to the storage level.
Instead of using a "graph abstraction" on top of another technology, the data is stored in Neo4j in the same way you may whiteboard your ideas.

Since 2007, Neo4j has evolved into a rich ecosystem of tools, applications, and libraries. 
This ecosystem allows you to integrate graph technologies with your working environment in a number of ways which are here described.

Beyond the core graph, Neo4j also provides ACID transactions, <<cluster>> support, and runtime failover.

[NOTE]
====
Neo4j is written in Java and Scala.
You can check the source code on https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j[GitHub^].

== How to interact with Neo4j

Neo4j uses xref:cypher.adoc[Cypher], a declarative query language similar to SQL, but optimized for graphs.
The same language is also used by other databases such as SAP HANA Graph and Redis graph via the http://www.opencypher.org/[openCypher project].

Another option is to use link:https://neo4j.com/docs/drivers-apis/[drivers].
Neo4j currently supports Java, JavaScript, .NET, Python, Go, GraphQL, Spring, and more.

== Create a Neo4j instance

Deploying a database is the first step to take to explore Neo4j.
link:{docs-home}/deployment-options[Choose a deployment method] that better suits your project among the following options:

=== Fully managed cloud service

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/[Neo4j AuraDB] is a fully managed cloud service that allows you to start exploring Neo4j right from your browser.

If you are a data scientist, you might also want to check link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/aurads/[Neo4j AuraDS] and get access to more than 65 pretuned link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/[graph algorithms].

Neo4j Aura has both free and subscription-based editions.
link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/[See full comparison].

=== Self-managed cloud services

You can also deploy your graph database on a link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/cloud-deployments[cloud platform] of your choice.
Neo4j works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. 

For this option, you need to link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/installation/[install Neo4j] to your machine or use link:{docs-home}/desktop-manual[Neo4j Desktop] in case your project is not in a production environment.

Neo4j is available for installation on link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/[Linux], link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/osx/[macOs], and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/windows/[Windows].

=== Self-managed local deployment

If you prefer to work with a local deployment, you can follow the same instructions: install link:{docs-home}/desktop-manual[Neo4j Desktop] in case you are not working in a production environment or link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/installation/[install Neo4j] to your machine.

==== Neo4j on Docker

link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/docker[Docker] can be downloaded for macOS, Windows, and Linux from the link:https://www.docker.com/get-started[DockerHub].
It hosts an official Neo4j image that provides a standard, ready-to-run package of Neo4j Community Edition and Enterprise Edition for a variety of versions.

==== Neo4j on Kubernetes

With Neo4j Helm charts, you can deploy both a standalone and a cluster deployment of link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/kubernetes[Neo4j on Kubernetes], and use configuration options suitable for the most common scenarios. 

[NOTE]
Neo4j has free and subscription-based licensing options.
Read more about the link:https://neo4j.com/licensing/[available editions].

== Work with data

After creating your database, you can take different paths depending on whether you want to work with your own data or use Neo4j's example datasets:

* *Own data*: There are several ways to link:{docs-home}/import[import] data to Neo4j.
In case your dataset is not set for a graph database, it is recommended to link:{docs-home}/getting-started/data-modeling/[model] it for a better experience.
* *Example datasets*: Both link:{docs-home}/aura[Aura] and link:{docs-home}/desktop-manual/[Neo4j Desktop] feature embedded guides that allow you to create example datasets and start querying.
To access them, write `:guide` in Auraâ€™s *Query* tab or in Browser, if you are using Neo4j Desktop. 
You can also xref:reference/example-data.adoc[download] the example datasets and then import them to your instance.

=== Neo4j tools

Neo4j has a catalogue of tools that can be used for various ends such as database administration, data visualization, and more.
You can check all products in the link:{docs-home}/tools[Tools] hub.

=== Supported libraries

Neo4j supports several of the most the popular link:{docs-home}/create-applications[query languages] and also offers proprietary libraries for a customized experience:

* The link:{docs-home}/gds/[Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS)] library provides implementations of common graph algorithms and machine learning pipelines to train predictive supervised models.
You can use them to solve graph problems, such as predicting missing relationships, for example.

* The link:{docs-home}/ogm-manual[Object Graph Mapping (OGM)] library, maps nodes and relationships in the graph to objects and references in a domain model.
You can use this resource to start tracking changes and minimize necessary updates and transitive persistence (reading and updating neighborhoods of an object).

=== APIs

Neo4j currently offers three proprietary link:{docs-home}/create-applications/#_apis[APIs]:

* The link:{docs-home}/http-api[Neo4j HTTP API] allows you to execute a series of Cypher statements against a Neo4j instance through HTTP requests.
* The link:{docs-home}/cdc[Change Data Capture (CDC) API] allows you to capture and track changes to your database in real-time, as well as keep data sources up to date.
* The link:{docs-home}/query-apip[Neo4j Query API] allows you to develop client applications in languages not currently supported by Neo4j.

[NOTE]
====
At link:https://neo4j.com/labs/[Neo4j Labs], you can find experimental projects including APIs, libraries, and visualization tools.
