== First steps with Neo4j

1. If you want to learn Neo4j graph database features, how to write Cypher queries, use developer tools like xref:get-started-with-neo4j/graph-platform.adoc#neo4j-tools[Neo4j Browser and Bloom], and get an overview on how to connect to Neo4j via drivers and connectors, go to the link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/[AuraDB page], where you can create a new Neo4j instance free forever. +
AuraDB is the best choice for cloud developers who are interested in graph technologies. +
Besides the free option, you can select the subscription plan which suits you best. +
At the moment, you can choose one of the example datasets on Aura to learn more about Neo4j and Cypher queries:
* Movies
* Graph based Recommendations
* Graphs for Cybersecurity
* StackOverflow Data
+
If you are a data scientist, you might be interested in link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-data-science/[AuraDS] -- graph data science platform as a fully managed cloud service.
You get access to more than 65 pretuned link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/[graph algorithms].

2. If you want to learn more about Neo4j graph database and Cypher queries applied to a specific use case, visit link:https://login.neo4j.com/u/login?state=hKFo2SBRRWZOaW5tSXI4OFFqdk53YjJ5QmhMV2VmdV9PMFBMY6Fur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIG4yX3lVYVhObFNzdjFrYVNOVEtzVk16alp4Y2ZudThKo2NpZNkgRHhobWlGOFRDZXpuSTdYb2kwOFV5WVNjTEdabms0a2U[Neo4j Sandbox], where you find a number of example datasets based on different use cases.
+
All databases are grouped into two categories:
+
* for developers
* for data scientists
+
You can also select a blank sandbox and populate it with your own data.
+
3. One of the ways to set up an environment for developing an application with Neo4j and Cypher is to use Neo4j Desktop.
Download Neo4j Desktop from link:https://neo4j.com/download/[] and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. +
You get the opportunity to try all the graph applications, which are available in our link:https://install.graphapp.io/[**Graph Apps Gallery**]. +
+
4. If you need an Enterprise Edition, visit link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/#graph-database/[the Neo4j Pricing page] where you can get all necessary instructions and contacts.
