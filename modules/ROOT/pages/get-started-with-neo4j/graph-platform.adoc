Reference documentation is at https://neo4j.com/docs/[]. +
If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out to the https://community.neo4j.com[Online Community^]!

Below you also find links to the homepages of the Neo4j products.   

[[graph-database]]
=== Neo4j Graph Database

link:https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/?ref=product/[Neo4j Graph Database^] -- our core product, native graph database that is built to store and retrieve connected data. + 
link:https://neo4j.com/licensing/[Two editions^] -- a Community Edition and an Enterprise Edition -- are available. +
There are many ways to deploy Neo4j today: on-premises server installation, self-hosted in the cloud with pre-built images, or by simply using *Neo4j Aura* -- the zero-admin, always-on graph database for cloud developers. +
All necessary documentation on how to install and maintain Neo4j can be found on the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/[docs page]. 

[[neo4j-aura]]
=== Neo4j Aura

Neo4j is a link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/[cloud-friendly] database, with a variety of cloud deployment options readily available.
You are able to run Neo4j on public clouds like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). +
Neo4j Aura is a fully managed, cloud-native graph service, giving developers and data scientists the most advanced graph tech tools.
Neo4j Aura includes *AuraDB* and *AuraDS*.

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/?ref=product[Neo4j AuraDB^] is the fully automated, always-on, and scalable graph database as a service for developers building modern applications. +
Find out more information in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/current/[official documentation^]. +

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-data-science/[Neo4j AuraDS] makes it easy to run graph algorithms on Neo4j by integrating two main components:

* **Neo4j Database**, where graph data are loaded and stored, and Cypher queries and all database operations (for example user management, query termination, etc.) are executed;
* **Graph Data Science**, a software component installed in the Neo4j Database, whose main purpose is to run graph algorithms on in-memory projections of Neo4j Database data.

Neo4j AuraDS is available on GCP. 
See link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/#graph-data-science[pricing] page for details.
You can find more details in the https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/aurads/[official documentation] for AuraDS. 

[[neo4j-gds]]
=== Neo4j Graph Data Science 

link:https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science/?ref=product[Neo4j Graph Data Science^] (GDS) gives you access to more than 65 graph algorithms, which can be executed with Neo4j and optimized for enterprise workloads and pipelines.
GDS helps you to get insights from big data in order to answer critical questions and improve predictions.
GDS is the only connected data analysis platform that unifies the ML surface and graph database into a single workspace.
This way, data scientists run algorithms and ML models without jumping between tools for ETL.

See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[documentation^] for the library for more details.

It is the most established and intuitive query language to learn with property graphs.
Cypher can be characterized by following:

* easy to learn
* visual and logical
* secure, reliable, and data-rich
* open and flexible

// Cypher is one of the graph query languages that are being used as the base for a new *standard* language -- link:https://www.gqlstandards.org/home[Graph Query Language].
