[#relational-vs-graph]
== Relational database overview

Relational databases store highly-structured data in tables with predetermined columns and rows of specific types of information.
Due to the rigidity of their organization, relational databases require developers and applications to strictly structure the data used in their applications.

In relational databases, references to other rows and tables are indicated by referring to primary key attributes via foreign key columns.
`JOIN` s are computed at query time by matching primary and foreign keys of all rows in the connected tables.
These operations are compute-heavy and memory-intensive, and have an exponential cost.

When many-to-many relationships occur in the model, you must introduce a `JOIN` table (or associative entity table) that holds foreign keys of both the participating tables, further increasing join operation costs:

The diagram shows the concept of connecting an `Employee` (from the `Employee` table) to a `Department` (in the `Departments` table) by creating a `Dpt_Members` join table that contains the ID of the employee in one column and the ID of the associated department in another column.

This structure makes understanding the connections cumbersome, because you must know the `Employee` and the `Department` ID values (performing additional lookups to find them) in order to know which employee connects to which department.

Additionally, these types of costly `JOIN` operations are often addressed by denormalizing the data to reduce the number of `JOIN` s necessary, therefore breaking the data integrity of a relational database.
Graph databases offer other ways to connect data.

== Translating relational knowledge to graphs

Unlike other database management systems, relationships are of equal importance to the data itself in a graph data model.
This means you are not required to infer connections between entities using special properties such as foreign keys or out-of-band processing like map-reduce.

By assembling nodes and relationships into connected structures, graph databases enable building models that map closely to a problem domain.
With Cypher's xref:cypher-intro/cypher-sql.adoc[equivalent of a `JOIN` operation], the graph database can directly access the connected nodes and eliminate the need for expensive search-and-match computations.

This ability to pre-materialize relationships into the database structure allows Neo4j to provide improved performance compared to others, especially for join-heavy queries.

[#rdbms-graph-model]
== Data model differences

The data models for relational and graph databases are vastly different, as a result of the structural differences previously described.
The graph model needs to consider access requirements, expected queries and performance, as well as business logic.

For example, if you want to know which departments Alice belongs to, this is how a relational and a graph databases structure the same data:

image::relational-as-graph.svg[Representation of tabular data in a relational database and the comparison with the same data structured in a graph,role=popup]

In the relational example, on the left, you need to: 

. Search the `Employees` table (potentially with thousands of rows) to find the user Alice and her ID of 815. 
. Search the `Dept_Members` table to locate all the rows that reference Alice's ID of 815.
. Once the 3 relevant rows are found, you go for the `Departments` table to search for the actual values of the department IDs (111, 119, 181).
. Only now you know that Alice is part of the 4Future, P0815, and A42 departments.

In the graph version, you need to:

. Search for Alice's `Employee` node.
. Traverse all of the `BELONGS_TO` relationships from Alice and find the `Department` nodes she is connected to.

[#rdbms-graph-query]
== Data storage and retrieval

SQL is a query language used to query relational databases.
xref:cypher.adoc[Cypher] is Neo4j’s declarative query language built on the basic concepts and clauses of SQL, but with additional functionalities that make working with graph databases more efficient.

For example, when writing an SQL statement with a large number of `JOIN` s, you can quickly lose sight of what the query actually does, since there is a lot of technical noise in SQL syntax.
In Cypher, the syntax remains concise and focused on domain components and their connections, thus expressing the pattern to find or create data more visually and clearly.

Other clauses outside of the basic pattern matching still look very similar to SQL, as Cypher was built on the predecessor language’s foundation. 
You can see the similarities and differences xref:/cypher-intro/cypher-sql.adoc[Comparing Cypher with SQL].
