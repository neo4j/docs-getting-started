== Built-in examples

Some example datasets can be retrieved directly from Workspace and Neo4j Browser in the form of guides.
With them, you can create or import a dataset and learn how to explore it.

=== Neo4j Workspace

When running your link:{docs-home}/aura[Aura instance], use the graduation cap icon on the top right section to access the interactive guides.
There you will find interactive guides that will help you create several of the xref:appendix/example-data.adoc#_available_datasets[available datasets] and learn how to work with them.

=== Neo4j Browser

Use the command `:guide` to access a list of built-in interactive guides or access them directly using these previously listed xref:appendix/example-data.adoc#_available_datasets[commands].

image:browser-guides.png[]

== Demo server

Optionally, you can access the demo server on https://demo.neo4jlabs.com:7473 to explore a number of datasets with read-only access for public use.

The username and password are the same as the dataset name.
For instance, for the `recommendations` dataset the username is `recommendations` and password is `recommendations` too.

Find the full list of datasets and the username/password entries to use in the xref:appendix/example-data.adoc#_available_datasets[available datasets] table.

== Database dump files

In the GitHub repository http://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples[Neo4j graph examples], you find dump files for several graph example datasets, including the ones listed previously in the xref:appendix/example-data.adoc#_available_datasets[available datasets] table.

There are several ways to load them, depending on the environment that is being used:

* link:{docs-home}/aura/aurads/importing-data/import-db/#_import_database[Aura]
* link:{docs-home}/desktop-manual/current/operations/create-from-dump/[Neo4j Desktop]
* link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/kubernetes/operations/dump-load/#kubernetes-neo4j-load[Kubernetes]
* link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/docker/dump-load/[Docker]
* link:{docs-home}/operations-manual/current/backup-restore/restore-dump/[Neo4j Admin]

You can also refer to the link:{docs-home}import/[Importing your data] section to learn more ways to load a dataset to your instance, including other supported file formats.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Neo4j version of some of the datasets might be older than your Neo4j version.
In this case, you might need to configure Neo4j to upgrade your database by using `neo4j-admin database migrate` command.
Note that this command is run only on a stopped database.
For more details, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/migrate-database/[Operations manual -> Tools].
