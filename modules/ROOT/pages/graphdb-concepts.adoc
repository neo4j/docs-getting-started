[[graphdb-example-graph]]
== Example graph

We will use the example graph below to introduce the basic concepts of the property graph:

image::graphdb-simple-labels.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-simple-labels.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// N2 -> N3 [
// label = "ACTED_IN\nroles = \[\'Forrest\'\]\l"
// ]
// N3 [
// label = "{Movie|title = \'Forrest Gump\'\lreleased = 1994\l}"
// ]
// N4 -> N3 [
// label = "DIRECTED\n"
// ]
// N4 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Robert Zemeckis\'\lborn = 1951\l}"
// ]
// ----

[[graphdb-nodes]]
== Nodes

Nodes are often used to represent _entities_.
The simplest possible graph is a single node.

Consider the graph below, consisting of a single node.

image::graphdb-simple-nodes.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-simple-nodes.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// ----

[[graphdb-labels]]
== Labels

Labels are used to shape the domain by grouping nodes into sets where all nodes that have a certain label belongs to the same set.

//Labels are used when defining constraints and adding indexes for properties (see <<graphdb-schema>>).

For example, all nodes representing users could be labeled with the label `:User`.
With that in place, you can ask Neo4j to perform operations only on your user nodes, such as finding all users with a given name.

Since labels can be added and removed during runtime, they can also be used to mark temporary states for nodes.
A `:Suspended` label could be used to denote bank accounts that are suspended, and a `:Seasonal` label can denote vegetables that are currently in season.

A node can have zero to many labels.

In the example above, the nodes have the labels `Person` and `Movie`, which is one possible way of describing the data.
But assume that we want to express different dimensions of the data.
One way of doing that is to add more labels.

Below is an example showing the use of multiple labels:

image::graphdb-simple-labels-multi.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-simple-labels-multi.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{Person\nActor|name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// N3 [
// label = "{Movie|title = \'Forrest Gump\'\lreleased = 1994\l}"
// ]
// N4 [
// label = "{Person\nDirector|name = \'Robert Zemeckis\'\lborn = 1951\l}"
// ]

// ----

[[graphdb-relationships]]
== Relationships

A relationship connects two nodes.
Relationships organize nodes into structures, allowing a graph to resemble a list, a tree, a map, or a compound entity -- any of which may be combined into yet more complex, richly inter-connected structures.

Our example graph will make a lot more sense once we add relationships to it:

image::graphdb-simple-rels.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-simple-rels.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// N2 -> N3 [
// label = "ACTED_IN\nroles = \[\'Forrest\'\]\l"
// ]
// N3 [
// label = "{title = \'Forrest Gump\'\lreleased = 1994\l}"
// ]
// N4 -> N3 [
// label = "DIRECTED\n"
// ]
// N4 [
// label = "{name = \'Robert Zemeckis\'\lborn = 1951\l}"
// ]
// ----

[[graphdb-relationship-types]]
== Relationship types

A relationship must have exactly one relationship type.

Our example uses `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` as relationship types.
The `roles` property on the `ACTED_IN` relationship has an array value with a single item in it.

Below is an `ACTED_IN` relationship, with the `Tom Hanks` node as the _source node_ and `Forrest Gump` as the _target node_.

image::graphdb-nodes-and-rel.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-nodes-and-rel.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// graph [rankdir="LR"]
// N2 [
// label = "{name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// N2 -> N3 [
// label = "ACTED_IN\nroles = \[\'Forrest\'\]\l"
// ]
// N3 [
// label = "{title = \'Forrest Gump\'\lreleased = 1994\l}"
// ]
// ----

We observe that the `Tom Hanks` node has an _outgoing_ relationship, while the `Forrest Gump` node has an _incoming_ relationship.

Relationships always have a direction.
However, you only have to pay attention to the direction where it is useful.
This means that there is no need to add duplicate relationships in the opposite direction unless it is needed in order to properly describe your use case.

Note that a node can have relationships to itself.
If we want to express that `Tom Hanks` `KNOWS` himself, that would be expressed as:

image::graphdb-nodes-and-rel-self.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-nodes-and-rel-self.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// N2 -> N2 [
// label = "KNOWS"
// ]
// ----

[[graphdb-properties]]
== Properties

Properties are name-value pairs that are used to add qualities to nodes and relationships.

In our example graphs, we have used the properties `name` and `born` on `Person` nodes, `title` and `released` on `Movie` nodes, and the property `roles` on the `:ACTED_IN` relationship.

The value part of the property can hold different data types such as `number`, `string` and `boolean`.
For a thorough description of the available data types, refer to the xref:4.3@cypher-manual:ROOT:syntax/values/index.adoc#cypher-values[Cypher manual].

[[graphdb-traversal]]
== Traversals and paths

A traversal is how you query a graph in order to find answers to questions, for example: "What music do my friends like that I don't yet own?", or "What web services are affected if this power supply goes down?".

Traversing a graph means visiting nodes by following relationships according to some rules.
In most cases only a subset of the graph is visited.

If we want to find out which movies Tom Hanks acted in according to our tiny example database, the traversal would start from the `Tom Hanks` node, follow any `:ACTED_IN` relationships connected to the node, and end up with `Forrest Gump` as the result (see the dashed lines):

image::graphdb-traversal.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-traversal.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// style = "dashed"
// ]
// N2 -> N3 [
// label = "ACTED_IN\nroles = \[\'Forrest\'\]\l"
// style = "dashed"
// ]
// N3 [
// label = "{Movie|title = \'Forrest Gump\'\lreleased = 1994\l}"
// style = "dashed"
// ]
// N4 -> N3 [
// label = "DIRECTED\n"
// ]
// N4 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Robert Zemeckis\'\lborn = 1951\l}"
// ]
// ----

The traversal result could be returned as a path with the length one:

image::graphdb-path.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-path.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// graph [rankdir="LR"]
// N2 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// N2 -> N3 [
// label = "ACTED_IN\nroles = \[\'Forrest\'\]\l"
// ]
// N3 [
// label = "{Movie|title = \'Forrest Gump\'\lreleased = 1994\l}"
// ]
// ----

The path above has length one.

The shortest possible path has length zero.
It contains a single node and no relationships.
For example:

image::graphdb-path-zero.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-path-zero.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// ----

This path has length one:

image::graphdb-path-example-loop.svg[role="middle"]

// ["dot", "graphdb-path-example-loop.svg", "neoviz"]
// ----
// N2 [
// label = "{Person|name = \'Tom Hanks\'\lborn = 1956\l}"
// ]
// N2 -> N2 [
// label = "KNOWS"
// ]
// ----

[[graphdb-schema]]
== Schema

A _schema_ in Neo4j refers to indexes and constraints.

Neo4j is often described as _schema optional_, meaning that it is not necessary to create indexes and constraints.
You can create data -- nodes, relationships and properties -- without defining a schema up front.
Indexes and constraints can be introduced when desired, in order to gain performance or modeling benefits.


[[graphdb-indexes]]
=== Indexes

Indexes are used to increase performance.
To see examples of how to work with indexes, see xref::/cypher-intro/schema.adoc#cypher-intro-indexes[Using indexes].
For detailed descriptions of how to work with indexes in Cypher, see xref:4.3@cypher-manual:ROOT:indexes-for-full-text-search/index.adoc#administration-indexes-fulltext-search[Cypher Manual -> Indexes].

[[graphdb-constraints]]
=== Constraints

Constraints are used to make sure that the data adheres to the rules of the domain.
To see examples of how to work with indexes, see xref::/cypher-intro/schema.adoc#cypher-intro-constraints[Using constraints].
For detailed descriptions of how to work with constraints in Cypher, see the xref:4.3@cypher-manual:ROOT:constraints/index.adoc[Cypher manual -> Constraints].


[[graphdb-naming-rules-and-recommendations]]
== Naming rules and recommendations

Node labels, relationship types and properties are case sensitive, meaning for example that the property `name` means something different than the property `Name`.
It is recommended to follow the naming conventions described in the following table:

.Naming conventions
[options="header"]
|===
| Graph entity      | Recommended style                                       | Example
| Node label        | Camel case, beginning with an upper-case character      | `:VehicleOwner` rather than `:vehice_owner`
| Relationship type | Upper case, using underscore to separate words          | `:OWNS_VEHICLE` rather than `:ownsVehicle`
| Property          | Lower camel case, beginning with a lower-case character | `firstName` rather than `first_name`
|===


For the precise naming rules, refer to the xref:4.3@cypher-manual:ROOT:syntax/naming/index.adoc#cypher-naming[Cypher manual -> Naming rules and recommendations].
