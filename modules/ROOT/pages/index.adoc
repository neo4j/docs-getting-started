With a native graph database at the core, Neo4j stores and manages data in a natural, connected state.
The graph database takes a property graph approach, which is beneficial for both traversal performance and operations runtime. +

.Components of the Neo4j Graph Data Platform

Neo4j started as a graph database and has evolved into a rich ecosystem with many tools, applications, and libraries, which allows you to integrate graph technologies with your working environment. +

For more information about each of the components, go to the link:https://neo4j.com/product/[Product page^]. +
For more details about reference documentation, see xref:get-started-with-neo4j/index.adoc#neo4j-docs[Neo4j documentation]. +
*The latest version of Neo4j is {neo4j-version-minor}.*

[[graph-database]]
=== Neo4j Graph Database

link:https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/?ref=product/[Neo4j Graph Database^] is the core product, a native graph database that is built to store and retrieve connected data. + 
link:https://neo4j.com/licensing/[Two editions^], a Community Edition and an Enterprise Edition, are available. +
There are various ways to deploy Neo4j: on-premises server installation, self-hosted in the cloud with pre-built images, or by simply using *Neo4j Aura*. +
You can find all necessary documentation on how to install and maintain Neo4j on the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/[Documentation page^]. 

[[neo4j-aura]]
=== Neo4j Aura

Neo4j is a link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/[cloud-friendly] database, with a variety of cloud deployment options available.
You can run Neo4j on public clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). +
*Neo4j Aura* is a fully managed, cloud-native graph service, that gives developers and data scientists advanced graph tech tools.
Neo4j Aura includes *AuraDB* and *AuraDS*.

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/?ref=product[Neo4j AuraDB^] is a graph database as a service. +
For more information, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/current/[official documentation^]. +

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-data-science/[Neo4j AuraDS] makes it easy to run graph algorithms on Neo4j by integrating two main components:

* **Neo4j Database**, where graph data are loaded and stored, and Cypher queries and all database operations (for example user management, query termination, etc.) are executed.
* **Graph Data Science**, a software component installed in the Neo4j Database, which main purpose is to run graph algorithms on in-memory projections of Neo4j Database.

Neo4j AuraDS is available on GCP. 
See link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/#graph-data-science[pricing] page for details.
You can find more details in the https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/aurads/[official documentation] for AuraDS. 

[[neo4j-gds]]
=== Neo4j Graph Data Science 

link:https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science/?ref=product[Neo4j Graph Data Science^] (GDS) gives you access to more than 65 graph algorithms, which can be executed with Neo4j and optimized for enterprise workloads and pipelines.
GDS helps you to get insights from big data in order to answer critical questions and improve predictions.
GDS is the connected data analysis platform that unifies the ML surface and graph database into a single workspace.

See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[documentation^] for the library for more details.

[[cypher]]
=== Cypher Query Language

link:https://neo4j.com/product/cypher-graph-query-language/?ref=product[Cypher] is an open data query language, based on the https://opencypher.org/?ref=cypher-web-page/[openCypher initiative].
It is the most established and intuitive query language used for property graphs.
Cypher can be characterized by following:

* easy to learn
* visual and logical
* secure, reliable, and data-rich
* open and flexible

See xref:cypher-intro/index.adoc[Introduction to Cypher] to get acquainted with Cypher basics.
