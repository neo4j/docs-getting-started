With a native graph database at the core, Neo4j stores and manages data in its more natural, connected state.
The graph database takes a property graph approach, which is beneficial for both traversal performance and operations runtime. +

Neo4j is dedicated to kind and open communication and aims to create developer-friendly environment for everybody. +
Neo4j is open-source and has the largest and most vibrant community of graph database enthusiasts. 
You can reach out to our link:https://community.neo4j.com/[Community Forum] or link:https://discord.com/invite/neo4j[Discord Chat] for any help or advice you may need. +

To help you to get more information about Neo4j products and projects, we would like to provide you with the xref::appendix/getting-started-resources.adoc[Getting started resources], which may inspire you to explore different possibilities of graph technologies. +

If you want learn how to build, optimize, and launch your Neo4j project, visit our link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/[GraphAcademy page].
GraphAcademy courses are free, interactive, and hands-on. +
All of them have been developed by Neo4j professionals with years of experience.
Our set of courses aims a wide range of job role: data scientists, developers, and database administrators.

*Neo4j Graph Data Platform*

Starting as a graph database Neo4j has evolved into a rich ecosystem with many tools, applications, and libraries, which give you opportunity to integrate graph technologies with your working environment. +

Let's take a look at the three pillars of the xref:get-started-with-neo4j/graph-platform.adoc#platform-components[Neo4j ecosystem]:

* First, **Neo4j** is the world’s leading **graph database**.
The architecture is designed for optimal management, storage, and traversal of _nodes_ and _relationships_.

* Second, **Neo4j Aura** is the fully managed graph data platform service in the cloud. 
Aura empowers developers and data scientists to quickly build scalable, AI-driven applications and analyze big data with algorithms without the hassle of managing infrastructure.
Neo4j Aura includes AuraDB for applications and AuraDS for data science.

* Third, **Neo4j Graph Data Science** is a connected data analytics and machine learning platform that helps you understand the connections in big data.

*Cypher*

Cypher is Neo4j’s graph query language that allows users to store and retrieve data from the graph database.
It is a declarative, SQL-inspired language for describing patterns in graphs.
The syntax provides a visual and logical way to match patterns of nodes and relationships in the graph.
Cypher has been designed to be easy to learn, understand, and use for everyone, but also incorporate the power and functionality of other standard data access languages.
