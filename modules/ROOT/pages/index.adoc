With a native graph database at the core, Neo4j stores and manages data in a natural, connected state.
The graph database takes a property graph approach, which is beneficial for both traversal performance and operations runtime. +

.Overview of the Neo4j ecosystem
image::neo4j-architecture-diagram.svg[role="popup-link"]

Neo4j started as a graph database and has evolved into a rich ecosystem with numerous tools, applications, and libraries.
This ecosystem allows you to seamlessly integrate graph technologies with your working environment. +

To explore more information about each component, visit the link:https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/[Neo4j Download center^]. +
For instructions on installing and deploying Neo4j, refer to the xref:get-started-with-neo4j/index.adoc#neo4j-docs[Neo4j documentation]. +
*The latest version of Neo4j is {neo4j-version-minor}.*

[[graph-database]]
== Neo4j Graph Database

link:https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/?ref=product/[Neo4j Graph Database^] is the core product, a native graph database that is built to store and retrieve connected data. + 
link:https://neo4j.com/licensing/[Two editions^], a Community Edition and an Enterprise Edition, are available. +
There are various ways to get started with Neo4j: 

* link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/[by installing on-premises] 
* link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/cloud-deployments/[by deploying on the cloud platform] of your choice
* by using {aura_signup}[Neo4j Aura]

You can find all necessary documentation on how to install and maintain Neo4j in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/[Operations manual^]. 

[[neo4j-aura]]
== Neo4j Aura

AuraDB and AuraDS are fully managed cloud service offerings.

{aura_signup}[Neo4j AuraDB^] is a graph database as a service.
For more information, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/current/[official documentation^].

To interact with an Aura instance, use link:https://neo4j.com/product/workspace/[Neo4j Workspace^] -- a low-code UI-based tool that helps you to design a data model, preview the model, import the data, and explore and query the database.

*Neo4j AuraDS* makes it easy to run graph algorithms on Neo4j by integrating two main components:

* **Neo4j Database**, where graph data are loaded and stored, and Cypher queries and all database operations (for example user management, query termination, etc.) are executed.
* **Graph Data Science**, a software component installed in the Neo4j Database, which main purpose is to run graph algorithms on in-memory projections of Neo4j Database.

Neo4j AuraDS is available on GCP. 
See link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/#graph-data-science[pricing] page for details.
You can find more details in the https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/aurads/[official documentation] for AuraDS. 

[[neo4j-gds]]
== Neo4j Graph Data Science 

link:https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science/?ref=product[Neo4j Graph Data Science^] (GDS) gives you access to more than 65 graph algorithms, which can be executed with Neo4j and optimized for enterprise workloads and pipelines.
GDS helps you to get insights from big data in order to answer critical questions and improve predictions.
GDS is the connected data analysis platform that unifies the ML surface and graph database into a single workspace.

See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[documentation^] for the library for more details.
