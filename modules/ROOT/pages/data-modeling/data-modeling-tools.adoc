Neo4j offers a range of no-code tools to get you started with data modeling.
Available options are here listed.

== Neo4j Data Importer

Besides being a tool for xref:data-import/index.adoc[importing data], you can use Neo4j Data Importer to sketch a graph model and map your data to it.
You can access it:

* Via *Import* in link:https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/?ref=docs-nav-get-started[Neo4j Aura].
* As a standalone version link:https://data-importer.neo4j.io/[with secure connection only] or link:https://data-importer.graphapp.io/[with both secure and insecure connections].

For more information, refer to link:{docs-home}/data-importer/[Neo4j Data Importer's documentation].

== Arrows.app

link:https://arrows.app[Arrows.app] is a no-code visualization platform which allows whiteboarding ideas into a graph model.
It is ideal for designing a domain model for your data.

With this platform, you can:

* Draft your own whiteboard from scratch or import data from JSON files and plain text.
* Create, modify, and delete nodes and relationships with their labels and properties without writing any code.
* Export the visualization as a Cypher statement and load it into a Neo4j database.

== Cypher Workbench

link:https://help.neo4j.solutions/neo4j-solutions/cypher-workbench/[Cypher Workbench] is a cloud-based tool that assists Neo4j developers in creating and maintaining solutions built on top of Neo4j. 
It combines no-code visual solutions as the ones available in link:https://arrows.app[Arrows.app] while also offering importing options similar to link:{docs-home}/data-importer[Neo4j Data Importer].

With this platform, you can:

* Create a data model from scratch or import data from JSON files.
* Reverse-engineer data models from existing Neo4j databases.
* Use Cypher statements to augment the current data model, including node labels, relationship types, and properties.
* Validate your model (naming conventions, constraints, data, common mistakes, etc).
* Use a business scenarios tool for capturing questions and scenarios of use cases.
* Import data from Excel, Google Sheets, or plain text.

For instructions on how to install it, refer to link:https://help.neo4j.solutions/neo4j-solutions/cypher-workbench/installation/[Cypher Workbench's documentation].

== Other tools

There are other non-Neo4j tools that can be used for data modeling:

* link:https://mermaid.live/[Mermaid]: general data modeling tool (not specifically for graph databases), based on Markdown.
Ideal for documenting modeling strategies.
* link:https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML]: application for creating diagrams from plain text.
This is more for version control than model design.
* link:https://hackolade.com/[Hackolade]: a tool to design, document, and communicate data models and schemas.
Built to support the kind of data modeling specific to Neo4j with node labels and relationship types.
