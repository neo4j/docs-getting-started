Data modeling is a practice that defines the logic of queries and the structure of the data in storage.
It is an important step to take when using any type of database, as it helps ensuring data integrity and improved performance.

This section gets you started with data modeling by introducing the concept, designs, tips, and how to migrate from relational to graph databases.

== How to create a graph data model

There are different ways to organize data into a model.
For example, using a whiteboard to show how different items are related is quite common when designing <<data models>>.

For a relational database, the model on the whiteboard must then be re-formatted and structured to fit normalized tables.
Graph data models, however, are _whiteboard-friendly_ since the data model stays the same as drawn on the whiteboard.

Take this example using data about the movie "The Matrix", also found in the xref:appendix/example-data.adoc[*Movies* example dataset]:

.Matrix - whiteboard model
image::matrix-whiteboard-model.png[500,500,role="popup-link"]

To turn the whiteboard model into a proper graph data model, the entities need to be turned into <<nodes>> and the connections between them into <<relationships>>:

.Matrix - match node and relationship format of property graph model
image::matrix-whiteboard-model2.svg[500,500,role="popup-link"]

The next step is to add <<labels>> and determine <<properties>> for the nodes and relationships:

.Matrix - add labels and properties
image::matrix-whiteboard-model3.svg[500,500,role="popup-link"]

You can visualize the model in Neo4j Browser or Query.
First, write the data to the database using xref:cypher.adoc[Cypher]:

[source,cypher]
--
CREATE (p1:Person:Actor {name: "Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m1:Movie {title: "Cloud Atlas"})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p2:Person:Actor {name: "Hugo Weaving"}),
(p2)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m2:Movie {title: "The Matrix"})<-[:DIRECTED]-(p3:Person:Director {name: "Lana Wachowski"}),
(p3)-[:DIRECTED]->(m1)
--

Then, use the following query to visualize the data you just wrote:

[source,cypher]
--
MATCH p=()-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:DIRECTED]-()
RETURN p
--

The visualization should look like this:

.Matrix - final model in Neo4j

If you are new to the Cypher query language, refer to xref:cypher.adoc[What is Cypher] for an introduction.

=== Domain description

It is easier to understand the process of designing a graph data model if you consider the domain.
As an example, consider the following scenario:

* Two _people_, *Sally* and *John*, +++<u>are friends</u>+++.
* Both *John* and *Sally* +++<u>have read</u>+++ the _book_ *Graph Databases*.

You can use this information to build a data model by identifying the components as labels, nodes, and relationships.
If you break up the scenario into smaller components, you can define them as parts of your property graph model. 

Start by simplifying the model:

image::property-graph-elements-arr.svg[400,400,role="popup-link"]

In the model, you can see that:

* Nodes (circles) represent objects and people.
* Nodes can have properties (name/value pairs).
* Relationships (arrows) connect nodes and represent actions.
* Relationships are directional and can have properties (name/value pairs).


=== Refactoring

Data models can be designed in different ways.
In the previous example, the nodes _Sally_ and _John_ both have the same label, `Person` and their names are added as properties.
In this small model, similar results could be achieved by using the names as labels instead.
However, it would be cumbersome if you wanted to add more people to the graph.
In that case, it would be advisable to group all people nodes using the label `Person`.

Updating the way you organize your data (e.g. turning nodes into node properties) is called xref:data-modeling/graph-model-refactoring.adoc[refactoring] and the iterations are called versioning.

=== Design strategy

Neo4j is *schema-free*, which means that the data model can adapt as a project advances, making refactoring and versioning easier.
This allows developers and architects to have more flexibility when determining the structure of the data model and how to define entities for queries.

Datasets often have many things in common (for example, domains, objects, measurements), and there are existing strategies you can follow.
Refer to xref:data-modeling/modeling-designs.adoc[Modeling designs] for a more detailed explanation.
