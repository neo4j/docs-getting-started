Data modeling is a practice that defines the logic of queries and the structure of the data in storage.
A well-designed model is the key to leveraging the strengths of a graph database as it improves query performance, supports flexible queries, and optimizes storage.

In summary, the process of creating a <<data model>> includes the following:

. Understand the domain and define specific use cases (questions) for the application.
. Develop an initial graph data model by extracting entities and decide how they relate to each other.
. Test the use cases against the initial data model.
. Create the graph with test data using Cypher.
. Test the use cases, including performance against the graph.
. Refactor the graph data model due to changes in the key use cases or for performance reasons.
